SubbutApp is an app for a Subbuteo competition based on three different games, Championship, Champions League, and Cup (which in italian are Campionato, Champions, and Coppa Italia, respectively).

To make it work:

 - modify file app/src/main/java/it/subbuteo/subbutapp/globals/Globals.java providing links where the jsons for match, hall_of_fame, and images data are stored (following json schemas in folder json_schemas)

 - copy in app/src/main/res/drawable the images for each player, for all the games
